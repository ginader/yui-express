This is an extended Version of Dav Glass' Code that runs: http://express.davglass.com/

I added a form validation example that completely reuses the javascript to do form validation on the frontend and on the backend thanks to the power of yui3 on both ends.

You must have git, NodeJS 0.2.1 and npm 0.2.0 installed

To use it, follow these simple steps:

    npm install yui3
    npm install yui3-gallery
    npm install yui3-2in3

    git clone git://github.com/ginader/yui-express.git

    cd yui-express

For a normal run:
    ./server.js

Visit: http://localhost:3200/

To use Spark: http://github.com/senchalabs/spark

Install spark via:

    npm install spark
    spark

Visit: http://localhost:3200/
